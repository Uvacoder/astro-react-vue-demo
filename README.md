# Astro + React + Vue Counter Demo

This is an incredibly small demo of using React and Vue together in an Astro project, with a variable passed in to both.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command         | Action                                      |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| `npm install`   | Installs dependencies                       |
| `npm run start` | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000` |
| `npm run build` | Build your production site to `./dist/`     |
